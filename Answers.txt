Bug   |  Solution   
Ex) Bug with application error handler in error-handler.js | removed code pointing to incorrect file

1. Cannot find Module 'axios' in 'PhotoContext.js' | install axios

2. <h2>{searchTerm + 'ERROR?'} Pictures</h2> wrong formatting | <h2>{searchTerm} Pictures</h2>

3. In PhotoContext.js axios call setLoading(True) | setLoading(False)

4. Form Magnifying button not visible, was set to disabled=true | disabled={!searchEntry.trim()} -> only be able to search if text
in search box. changed fill color from #ffffff to #000000 for visibility (magnifying glass color)

5. Cannot type in search bar because value={searchEntry} | comment out value={searchEntry}

6. Cannot search words in search bar | Form will be a Consumer component of Provider PhotoContext component. Provider
Component should be able to share data with consumer components via props (idea is to send what ever is in the searchbar
to PhotoContext as a query and display those images).
